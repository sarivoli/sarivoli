## 👋 About Me

I am a **Product & Delivery Leader who builds systems, not just code**.

My core strength lies in operating at the intersection of:
- **Leadership & Ownership**
- **Product Thinking & Architecture**
- **Delivery Excellence & Governance**
- **Hands-on System Building**

I specialize in transforming **complex delivery environments into predictable, scalable systems** by combining strong execution discipline with thoughtful product design.

I do not just manage teams — I **design operating models, build tools, and engineer execution frameworks** that make success repeatable.

## 🎯 What I Do

- **Product & Delivery Leadership** – Owning outcomes across multi-team, multi-client programs  
- **System Building** – Designing internal products, accelerators, and automation frameworks  
- **Sprint & Release Governance** – Scope discipline, quality gates, delivery predictability  
- **Process Engineering** – Creating checklists, metrics, escalation models, and execution playbooks  
- **Stakeholder Leadership** – Clear, confident communication with leadership and clients
